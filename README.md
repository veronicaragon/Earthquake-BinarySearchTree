# Earthquake Binary Search Tree Lab 🌎🌳 

Welcome to the Earthquake Binary Search Tree Lab! This Java program explores the implementation of a binary search tree to manage earthquake data based on magnitude.

## Explore the Lab 👀 

The program provides functionality to add earthquake data to the binary search tree, search for earthquakes by magnitude, and display the tree in an in-order traversal.

## How to Use ✍️ 

1. **Add Earthquake:**
   - Use the `add` method to add an earthquake object to the binary search tree. Returns `true` if the earthquake was added successfully.

2. **Search by Magnitude:**
   - Utilize the `search` method to find and return an earthquake that matches the target magnitude. Returns an earthquake object or `null` if not found.

3. **Display Tree:**
   - Execute the `display` method to showcase the binary search tree. The `inOrderTraversal` method is a helper recursive method that displays the tree in an in-order traversal.
